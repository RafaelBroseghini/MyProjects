money_inserted = float(input('Enter value of money inserted: ')) # Money has decimals therefore has to be a float statement.

item_price = float(input('Enter item price: '))

change = round(money_inserted - item_price, 2) # Before rounding the float(input) statement, python was giving different answers for the same amount of change. I would input 1.00 (money) and .40(item price) therefore change being .60 it would give me back 2 quarters and one dime (correct answer), but when I input 10.00 (money) and 9.40 (item price) therefore change being .60 python would give me back 2 quarters and one nickel (wrong answer).

change_print = ('Change: $') # Formulas are easier to insert in formatting later.
